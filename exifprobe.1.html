<B>NAME</B>
       exifprobe  -  probe and report structure and metadata content of camera
       image files

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>exifprobe</B> [<I>options</I>] <I>filename(s)</I>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Exifprobe</B> reads image files produced by digital cameras (including sev-
       eral  so-called  "raw"  file  formats) and reports the structure of the
       files and the auxilliary data and metadata contained  within  them.  In
       addition  to TIFF, JPEG, and EXIF, the program understands several for-
       mats which may contain "raw"  camera  data,  including  MRW,  CIFF/CRW,
       JP2/JPEG2000,  RAF,  and  X3F,  as well as most most TIFF-derived "raw"
       formats, including DNG, ORF, CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR, and PEF. Other TIFF
       or JPEG-derived formats (which begin with a TIFF header or JPEG marker)
       should also be readable.  The program attempts to display ALL  informa-
       tion  in  the image file, in a manner which mimics the structure of the
       file as closely as possible.

       Where possible, output is not limited to "known" data items.  I.e.  for
       tagged  file formats, unknown tags will be identified by tag number and
       type, and values shown without interpretation. Proprietary, untagged or
       fixed  format  files  do not permit this, but unknown or undefined data
       can usually be dumped in a hex/ascii format for examination, so long as
       the  file structure is understood. The program will report the contents
       of any properly structured TIFF IFD or CIFF directory encountered, even
       when entry tags are not recognized.  Recognized TIFF, TIFF/EP, DNG, and
       CIFF tags are expanded, including EXIF2.2 sections  and  camera  Maker-
       Notes  which are found to be in TIFF IFD format.  TIFF and/or JPEG sec-
       tions found in MRW, RAF or JP2 files will be reported, along  with  the
       "native"  sections of those formats. JP2 boxes will be reported whether
       known or unknown, and expanded  if  known.   Unknown  boxes  cannot  be
       expanded, since JP2 is not tagged below the box (or sub-box) level.

       An effort is made to identify all sub-images (in any image format) con-
       tained in multi-image files; the location, size,  and  format  of  such
       images  is  reported,  and  a  hex/ascii  dump of the image data may be
       requested. Image data is not processed, but the program will  recognize
       and  report all standard JPEG and JPEG2000 markers (including JPEG APPn
       markers) and will expand APP0 (JFIF/JFXX) and APP1 (EXIF) sections.

       Since the program does not attempt to display images or modify the con-
       tents  of  files, it can often recover from and report failures or warn
       about structural oddities which would confuse a display or  image  edit
       program.

       There are a wide variety of output formats, selectable in detail by the
       "lower case" options described in the  <B>OPTIONS</B>  section  below.   These
       options  select  which  items to print, and within narrow confines, how
       and where to print them.  A large number  of  combinations  of  options
       exist, and some of those combinations may not be sensible.  In order to
       avoid the need for constant creativity or invention,  three  "prefabri-
       cated"  output  formats are provided, selected by the <I>upper</I> <I>case</I> option
       letters.

       The <I>structural</I> (<B>-S</B>) output format (default) provides a  description  of
       the  image  file  which  mimics  as  closely as possible the layout and
       structure of the data in the image  file,  including  file  offsets  of
       headers,  section  and segment markers, fully described TIFF IFDs, CIFF
       directories, or JP2 boxes, and the  location  of  actual  image  and/or
       thumbnail  data.  The contents of each section are indented relative to
       the beginning of the section, and "offset" values  for  TIFF  IFDs  and
       CIFF directories are reported at the offsets where they are found (usu-
       ally following the entry list for TIFF, or in the HEAP for CIFF).   The
       peculiar  "reverse" structures of CIFF and X3F formats are handled sen-
       sibly.

       The <I>report</I> format (<B>-R</B>) shows the "logical" structure of the image file,
       but  eliminates  addresses,  offsets, IFD value types and counts, etc.,
       and prints "offset" directory values inline, while otherwise preserving
       the primary structure of the data.

       The  <I>list</I>  format  (<B>-L</B>) omits all structural data. It writes only "tag"
       values from TIFF, Exif, and MakerNote IFDs, CIFF or other format direc-
       tories  or  JP2  boxes,  including section and image offsets and sizes.
       Identifiable values from non-tagged formats are written  in  a  similar
       manner.  This format may be useful for extracting information for photo
       galleries.

       The <I>structural</I> format is default.  This format provides maximum  infor-
       mation  about the contents of an image file, and may reveal information
       (sometimes important) which other formats (or image info programs)  may
       hide.

       In  all  formats, the filename, file <I>type</I>, file size, an <I>image</I> <I>summary</I>,
       and a summary <I>file</I> <I>format</I> will be displayed (even when all other output
       is  disabled  by  option). The image summary includes a summary report,
       for each subimage found, giving the image type,  compression  type  (if
       any),  pixel size, data length, file offset where found, and section of
       the file which includes or references the image.  In some cases,  short
       remarks  may  be  included for images mentioned but not found, etc. The
       summary concludes with the number of images found, and number of images
       not found (if any). The summary is followed by a listing of format sec-
       tions found (TIFF/JPEG/EXIF, etc.) and  a  type  identifier  for  TIFF-
       derived types (e.g. <I>CR2</I>) where possible.

       An  environment  variable  may be set to a list of options to customize
       the default output behavior (see below).


   <B>MakerNotes</B>
       Camera-generated images which contain EXIF sections  may  also  contain
       sections  introduced  by a <I>MakerNote</I> tag, which may contain information
       about camera or firmware settings  used  to  produce  the  image.   The
       structure  and  contents  of  MakerNote sections is not mandated by the
       Exif specification, but many camera MakerNotes are written in TIFF  IFD
       format,  possibly  offset following an ID string or new TIFF header (or
       both), and sometimes with inventive handling of  "offsets".   <B>Exifprobe</B>
       currently understands and automatically detects such schemes and prints
       the contents of the IFD (and the ID string, if present).   This  detec-
       tion  is  not  dependent  upon make or model of camera.  <I>Make</I> and <I>Model</I>
       information will usually be available from the first TIFF  IFD  in  the
       file;  this information may be used to <I>interpret</I> the MakerNote informa-
       tion for "known" cameras; otherwise, tag numbers, sizes, types, and raw
       values from the IFD will be shown (if permitted by option settings).

       Some  camera makes are known to use more than one version of MakerNote,
       depending upon model.  If an unknown model from that maker  is  encoun-
       tered,  the  note  will  be briefly examined and a noteversion assigned
       automatically if possible.  If that fails, the note will  be  displayed
       without interpretation.

       MakerNotes  which are not in a recognizable IFD format will be reported
       (start and end offsets) in structural (<B>-S</B>) and report  (<I>-R</I>)  formats  ,
       and  the beginning of the note section hex/ascii dumped.  The remainder
       of the note may be dumped, in whole or in part, by the <I>-M</I>  option  (see
       below).

       In  list  (<I>-L</I>)  format, the starting file offset and length supplied by
       the MakerNote tag will be  reported,  and  three  "pseudo"  tags  which
       report  the  offset  (<I>MakerNote.Offset</I>),  size  (<I>MakerNote.Length</I>)  and
       scheme (<I>MakerNote.Scheme</I>) will appear.


   <B>JPEG</B> <B>APPn</B>
       In JPEG interchange format files, APP0 (JFIF,JFXX) and APP1 (Exif) seg-
       ments will be fully decoded, and the "printable" portions of APP12 sec-
       tions will be displayed. APP3 (Meta) sections will be expanded and  the
       contained TIFF IFD will be displayed, although little interpretation is
       done. Other APP markers will be  reported,  and  the  sections  may  be
       hex/ascii dumped in whole or in part using the <I>-A</I> option. APP1 sections
       not marked as <I>Exif</I> will be treated as unknown.


   <B>ANSI</B> <B>Color</B>
       The program (by default) emits ANSI color escape sequences to highlight
       Exif,  MakerNote , and Interoperability sub-sections.  Errors and warn-
       ings are highlighted in red.  These sequences are effective, of course,
       only  for terminals or terminal emulators (e.g. <B>xterm</B>) which respond to
       ANSI color escape sequences.  If a pager is used to display the  output
       when  these  sequences  are present, a "raw" option to the pager may be
       required (e.g. <B>less</B> -R).  The use of these sequences may be toggled  by
       the <B>-c</B> option.  LIST mode turns color sequences off.

       The program may be compiled without support for color sequences.


<B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B>
       In all formats, and regardless of option setting, the first three lines
       of output for each file processed are the filename, image  <I>type</I>  (TIFF,
       CIFF,  JP2, etc.), and the file size.  If the type (taken from the file
       header) specifies a data byte order, the byte order will  be  indicated
       with the type as `II' (Intel byte order) or `MM' (Motorola byte order).
       The image summary and summary format will always be printed at the end.


   <B>Structural</B> <B>Format</B>
       Structural format output begins with a display of the file header.  The
       header is followed by lines of the form
              <I>&lt;IFD0&gt;</I>
                  ...
              &lt;/IFD0&gt;
              <I>&lt;APP0&gt;</I>
                  ...
              &lt;/APP0&gt;
              <I>&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;</I>
                  ...
              &lt;/DIRECTORY&gt;
       etc.  to indicate the beginning and end of each "section" of the  file.
       Actual  section  names  will,  of  course,  depend upon the file format
       and/or the tags encountered.  Only the TIFF  IFD  format  is  described
       here;  other formats are similar, except that JP2 box names are printed
       inside square (rather than  angle)  brackets,  and  MRW  section  names
       inside curly braces.

       Within  sections,  directory  entries,  subdirectories, the contents of
       known APP sections, JPEG segment markers, etc. are  printed.   Non-jpeg
       image data sections will be shown with a few lines of hex/ascii dump of
       the beginning of the data.

       Each line of output is preceded by a file offset given in hex and deci-
       mal.   File  offsets  are  preceded  by  the character `@', except that
       section end markers are preceded by `-' and the character  `&gt;'  may  be
       used  to  mark sections which are located outside the IFD in which they
       are declared.  If that section includes a subsection which is similarly
       afflicted, the '&gt;' is replaced by '+' in the subsection.  In JP2 files,
       the '@' is replaced by '=', for no particular reason.

       JPEG and JPEG2000 segment markers are written with the marker name, and
       the decoded values of any information associated with the marker.

       TIFF information is written in a manner which reflects the structure of
       the IFD, with all values interpreted according to the applicable speci-
       fication  where  possible.  All IFD fields are reported.  The following
       fields will appear on each line (in the order given, following the file
       offset):

       <B>o</B>      Tag  number  in  hex  and  decimal  representations, enclosed in
              brackets.

       <B>o</B>      Tag name (where known); names for unknown tags are created as  a
              hex  representation  of  the  tag  number prefixed by the string
              'TAG_'.

       <B>o</B>      The TIFF type number, name, and byte count  for  the  associated
              value, enclosed in square brackets.

       <B>o</B>      The "value/offset" for the entry.  If the value fits in the four
              bytes of the entry, the value is printed directly.

              If the value for the entry did not fit in the four bytes of  the
              entry,  then the value found is an offset to the actual location
              of the data; that offset is printed preceded by an  '@'  symbol.
              The actual value will be printed later, at the file offset where
              it was found (except in some non-conforming MakerNote IFDs).  If
              the  value requires <I>interpretation</I> (e.g. TIFF <I>Orientation</I>) it is
              followed by an '=' sign and the interpretation, enclosed in dou-
              ble quotes (e.g. <I>"0,0</I> <I>top</I> <I>left"</I>).

       The list of entries will be followed by a line giving the offset to the
       next IFD (often 0) which is always found at the end of a TIFF IFD entry
       list.

       If  there  were  offset  entries found in the list above, the TIFF (and
       Exif) specification requires that they will  be  located  next  in  the
       file,  immediately  following  the dirctory entries.  This stricture is
       frequently ignored in MakerNotes  and  TIFF-derived  formats.   A  line
       reporting  the beginning of these offset values will be printed immedi-
       ately after the next IFD offset, followed by one line for  each  offset
       entry,  with  the tag name repeated, followed by the actual value, fol-
       lowed by its interpretation (if any).

       Multiple values in entries are printed on  a  single  line,  but  large
       lists  will  be  elided, with just the first two or three values shown,
       followed by an ellipsis, followed by the last value, the number of val-
       ues, and the offset of the last value in the list.  The full value list
       may be printed using the <B>-eA</B> option.


       In structural format, ascii strings in the entry are  printed  for  the
       entire  length  given  in  the IFD entry, including nulls and non-ascii
       values (if present), which are printed in `backslashed' octal notation.
       The  <B>-ea</B> option may be used to force ascii values to be printed only up
       to the first null.  This option is  often  necessary  for  CIFF  format
       files, and is enabled by default in "list" mode.

       Entries  are  indented  slightly from the start identifier for the IFD,
       and subsegments (e.g. an  Exif  IFD,  SubIFD,  or  MakerNote)  will  be
       further indented in order to indicate the structure of the file.

       The  resulting  output  displays  the  contents  of  the IFD much as it
       appears in the file (see the TIFF or EXIF specifications  for  descrip-
       tions of the IFD format).

       Finally,  the  start and end of actual image data for the primary image
       (and possibly thumbnail or reduced-resolution image) is reported at the
       end.   For  JPEG images, this usually includes display of the JPEG seg-
       ment markers within the image.  Binary format image data will be  shown
       with a brief hex/ascii dump of the beginning of the data, between start
       and end markers.

       <I>Note</I> that <I>values</I> preceded by `@' are always offsets <I>from</I> <I>the</I>  <I>beginning</I>
       <I>of</I>  <I>the</I>  <I>file</I> to the actual value.  IFD offsets are usually recorded in
       the file as offsets relative to the beginning of the TIFF header (which
       is  offset  from  the beginning of the file in JPEG APP1 files) but are
       adjusted by <B>exifprobe</B> to show offset from the beginning  of  the  file.
       If  it  is  important  to see the recorded value, the <B>-er</B> option may be
       used to print the recorded value in parentheses, following the adjusted
       file offset.


   <B>Report</B> <B>Format</B>
       The  <I>report</I> format (<I>-R</I>) displays all sections and segments of the image
       file, including start and end of sections, but eliminates much  of  the
       "cruft" of the structural format by eliminating address/offset informa-
       tion and much of the `internal' information from the TIFF IFD (tag num-
       ber,  type  and  count).  <I>Offset</I> values are printed inline with the tag
       name.  The output is indented to show  the  <I>logical</I>  structure  of  the
       image file, but is much less difficult to view than the structural for-
       mat.


   <B>List</B> <B>format</B>
       The <I>list</I> format (<I>-L</I>) suppresses structural  information,  writing  only
       <I>content</I>  in the format <I>tagname</I> <I>=</I> <I>value</I> or <I>tagname</I> <I>=</I> <I>value</I> <I>=</I> <I>"what</I> <I>value</I>
       <I>means"</I>. For non-tagged file formats, the tagname will be replaced by  a
       fixed  identifier  for  the  item.  In LIST format, "long" tagnames are
       used, which include the names of all parent sections of the section  in
       which  the  data  is found.  Long tagnames can be toggled off, although
       this is unwise if the file contains multiple image sections.

       The "value" of tags or items which represent an offset to a  subsection
       or image are printed in <I>list</I> format as "<I>@offset:length</I>".

       The  List  format is used by the auxilliary script <B>exifgrep</B>, which per-
       mits selective extraction of information e.g. for photo galleries,  and
       output in (almost) "shell variable" format.


   <B>Custom</B> <B>Formats</B>
       The  <B>-Z</B>  option  "zeroes"  all option flags (except the <I>longnames</I> modi-
       fier), after which the lower-case options may be used  to  set  desired
       options.   The lower-case options are `toggles', which may also be used
       to turn <I>off</I> items in the pre-defined formats.

       As an example, the command:

           <I>exifprobe</I> <I>-Z</I> <I>-et</I> <I>somefile.tif</I>

       may be used to list just the TIFF and Exif  tags,  without  values  (or
       anything else) in "long name" format.

            <I>exifprobe</I> <I>-eNnT</I> <I>somefile.tif</I>

       will  print in structural format, suppressing output of hex and decimal
       tag numbers, and tag type and count.

       The "zero-level" output still reports the file data and  image  summary
       as described above.


<B>OPTIONS</B>
       The  environment  variable  <B>EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS</B>  may  be set to any valid
       option string, which will be evaluated  before  command  line  options.
       E.g.

       export EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS='-L -c'

       will  make  list  format  the  default output format, and re-enable the
       color sequences turned off by <I>-L</I>.

       Options are evaluated from left to right, so <B>-Z</B> should be given  first,
       while <B>-D</B> (decimal only) or <B>-X</B> (hex only) should be given last.


       -S        Structure  mode:  (default)  almost everything; offset values
                 not inline

       -R        Report mode: like structural, but only tagnames  and  decimal
                 values, indented, inline

       -L        List  mode: print only tags and values (including interpreted
                 values); no section info; no color

       -Z        turn off (zero) all optional output.  Prints  only  filename,
                 filetype, filesize, image summary, and file format.

       -c        toggle  use of ANSI color control sequences to emphasize EXIF
                 sections.  (default 'on' except list  mode,  unless  compiled
                 with no color support)

       -a        toggle  printing of addresses (file offsets) in hex and deci-
                 mal

       -I        three-way toggle indent (after address -&gt; before -&gt; none)

       -o        toggle "inline" print of offset IFD values

       -p[items] toggle print identifiers for:

                 s   - sections (IFDs, APPn)

                 g   - segments (JPEG segments)

                 a   - JPEG APP0...APPn entries

                 l   - long names (dot-separated list of parent sections  pre-
                     ceding item name)

                 e   - entries. Includes tag names, numbers, types, values.

                 m   - print MakerNote scheme description

                 M   - watch debug of MakerNote scheme detection


       -e[items] toggle print IFD entry items:

                 t   - tagname

                 n   - tag number in decimal

                 N   - tag number in hex

                 T   - entry type and count

                 v   - value in decimal

                 V   - value in hex

                 o   - file offset to value in decimal

                 O   - file offset to value in hex

                 r   - relative (unadjusted) offset in decimal

                 R   -  also  print  "raw" values where normal values are com-
                     puted (e.g. rational values,  or  some  MakerNote  values
                     where APEX values must be computed from a raw value).

                 A   - print ALL elements of multiple-value tags

                 a   - ascii "ignore length" (stop at first null)

       -D        limit   all   enabled   numerical   values  to  decimal  only
                 (addresses, tag numbers, offsets, values)

       -X        limit all enabled numerical values to  hex  only  (addresses,
                 tag numbers, offsets, values)

       -U[len|a] dump  <I>len</I> (or all) bytes of UNDEFINED data found in TIFF IFDS
                 in hex/ascii form (but only if the structure of the  data  is
                 not known)

       -M[len|a] dump  <I>len</I>  (or  all)  bytes  of  unrecognized  MakerNotes  in
                 hex/ascii form (but only if the structure of the data is  not
                 known)

       -A[len|a] dump  <I>len</I> (or all) bytes of unrecognized JPEG APP segments in
                 hex/ascii form (but only if the structure of the data is  not
                 known)

       -B[len|a] dump  <I>len</I>  (or all) bytes of binary image data or failed JPEG
                 image data

       -C[make]+[model]
                 print a list of camera makes/models matching <I>make</I> or <I>model</I> as
                 substrings.  <B>`+'</B> by itself prints everything

       -O start_offset
                 start processing at file offset <I>start</I><B>_</B><I>offset</I>

       -n        print  filename  at  beginning of each line of output (useful
                 when grepping multiple files in LIST mode)

       -N noteversion
                 force use of note version <I>noteversion</I> when interpreting  Mak-
                 erNotes.  Useful only if you know what you're doing.

       -m make   Force  the  makernote code to interpret the note according to
                 the <I>make</I> given, rather than that contained in the file.

       -l model  force the makernote code to interpret the note  according  to
                 the <I>model</I> given, rather than that contained in the file.

       -t        This  option has effect only if set in <B>EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS</B>.  If
                 set when command line options are processed, color   will  be
                 be off <I>by</I> <I>default</I> if the output is not to a tty.  Any command
                 line option which toggles or sets color (e.g. "-R") will turn
                 color back on.

       -u        Print "raw" Unicode data.  Normally 16 bit data is printed as
                 though the high byte is  zero  (which  is  often  the  case).
                 Writing the nulls would annoy most ascii terminal devices, so
                 the default is more hospitable.  The <I>-u</I> option forces  print-
                 ing of the full value.

       -h        print a help message

       -V        print program version and copyright

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
       Most  diagnostics  are  printed  "inline" to stdout, in red if color is
       enabled, and the program attempts to proceed.

<B>BUGS</B>
       Interpretation of MakerNote data for specific cameras is incomplete and
       probably  always will be.  The X3F specification is incomplete, and the
       final JPEG2000/JP2 specification is not freely available;  support  for
       these  formats is therefore not complete, and may not be entirely accu-
       rate.

       The RAF file format support is preliminary (there is no published spec-
       ification).

       Floating  point  values  read  from the file are expected to be in IEEE
       format (or at least, native format); i.e. no conversions are attempted.

       ANSI  color sequence support should use termcap/terminfo facilities; it
       does not.
