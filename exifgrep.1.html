<B>EXIFGREP(1)</B>                                                        <B>EXIFGREP(1)</B>



<B>NAME</B>
       exifgrep - select and reformat the output of <B>exifprobe</B>


<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>exifgrep</B>  [options]  [<I>egrep</I><B>_</B><I>options</I>]  <I>egrep</I><B>_</B><I>pattern</I> [<I>NOT</I> <I>egrep-pattern]</I>
       <I>filename(s)</I>


<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Exifgrep</B> is a shell script which applies  <B>egrep(1)</B>  to  the  output  of
       <B>exifprobe</B> <I>-L</I>,  permitting easy selection and minor reformatting of out-
       put items.

       <B>exifprobe</B> is small, fast, and utterly  sycophantic  in  its  desire  to
       report  <I>everything</I>  it finds in an image.  <B>exifgrep</B> applies the regular
       expression matching capabilities of <B>egrep</B>  to  the  output  barrage  to
       extract only wanted information.

       <B>exifgrep</B> also performs a mild form of selection on the output fields of
       <B>exifprobe</B> <I>-L</I>.  Many items reported by exifprobe are represented in  the
       image file by a <I>number</I> which compactly represents a defined value.

       E.g. <B>exifprobe</B> <I>-L</I> may report

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit              = 2 = 'pixels per inch'

       where  the value "2" must be interpreted to mean that resolution values
       (<I>TIFF.IFd1.Xresolution</I> and IFF.IFd1.YResolution) are recorded in pixels
       per  inch,  rather than, say, pixels per centimeter.  <B>exifprobe</B> reports
       both fields; <B>exifprobe</B> may also report  interpreted  values  for  items
       which are recorded in unfamiliar units, such as

       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber           = 5.6 APEX = 'f7.0'

       In  all such cases, <B>exifgrep</B> reports (by default) only the "human read-
       able" field:

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit = 'pixels per inch'
       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber = 'f7.0'

       unless the "<I>-num</I>" option is given to select the numerical value.

       In addition, a `variable' format may be selected ("<I>-var</I>") which  elimi-
       nates  whitespace,  providing  a  format  which  typical shells may use
       directly to set variables for further processing.  E.g.

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit='pixels per inch'
       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber='f7.0'



<B>OPTIONS</B>
       -r        <I>file</I> arguments may be directories, which will be searched via
                 <B>find</B> for all image types recognized by <B>exifprobe</B>.

       -n        force <B>exifprobe</B> to print a filename for each line of its out-
                 put, which <I>exifgrep</I> will turn into a comment at  the  end  of
                 each matching line.

       -t        force <B>exifprobe</B> to print tag numbers for all itemes that have
                 them, so that matches may be  made  on  hex  or  decimal  tag
                 numbers.

       -c        turn on color output from <B>exifprobe</B>

       -h        print a usage message (help)

       -var      report  in "variable" format, which may be directly `sourced'
                 by any Bourne-compatible shell (except that most shells  will
                 insist  that the dots must be replaced, e.g. by underscores).

       -export   report in "variable" format,  but  with  a  Bourne-compatible
                 <I>export</I> command

       -num      report  numerical values rather than interpreted strings, for
                 fields which have both.


       NOTE: the <I>-var</I> and <I>-export</I> options are obsolescent; they  are  retained
       for compatibility with earlier versions of <I>exifprobe</I>.  A post-processor
       such as <I>reformat.sh</I> may be more effective for the  current  version  if
       shell-compatible output is desired.


       Any option not recognized by the script will be passed on to <B>egrep</B>.

       The  first  non-option  argument  will be used as the pattern passed to
       <B>egrep</B>.  This may be followed by the keyword <I>NOT</I> and an expression  rep-
       resenting matches to be <I>rejected</I>.  This pattern will be passed to <B>egrep</B>
       <I>-v</I>.  Only one argument of each type may  be  given,  and  the  "accept"
       expression (if given) must appear before the "reject" expression.

       All remaining arguments are interpreted as image filenames.
